# Multi-Paradigm Nature of JavaScript


In JavaScript, it's common to use a single object instead of multiple arguments, promoting cleaner and more maintainable code. 
This practice simplifies function calls by encapsulating related parameters within a single cohesive entity. 
By doing so, developers can enhance code readability and reduce the risk of parameter order errors


### Benefits:

1. Clarity: Passing a single object improves code clarity by clearly defining the purpose of each argument within the context of the function call.

2. Flexibility: As object properties can be added or removed without affecting function calls, this approach offers greater flexibility during code evolution.

3. Enhanced Maintainability: With related parameters grouped together, maintaining and updating function signatures becomes more straightforward, promoting codebase longevity.

### Destructuring:

Destructuring is a powerful feature in JavaScript that allows developers to extract values from objects or arrays and assign them to variables in a concise and readable manner.
This technique aligns well with the use of single objects as function arguments, enabling easy access to specific properties within the function body.

### Default Values for Function Arguments:

JavaScript supports default parameter values, enabling developers to specify fallback values in case arguments are not provided during function invocation. 
This feature enhances code robustness by ensuring that functions gracefully handle missing or undefined parameters without causing runtime errors.
